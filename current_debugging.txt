XCODE DIAGNOSTICS MCP PLUGIN DEBUGGING NOTES

ISSUE: The plugin is not reporting all diagnostic errors from Xcode build logs.

CURRENT STATUS:
- FIXED: Successfully enhanced the plugin to capture concurrency-related warnings
- Added more generic, project-independent regex patterns to detect warnings
- Removed hardcoded project-specific warnings in the code
- Added additional debug logging for concurrency-related warnings
- Tests pass successfully

CHANGES MADE:
1. Improved regex patterns for concurrency-related warnings:
   - Added patterns for Swift 6 language mode issues
   - Added patterns for 'nonisolated global shared' warnings
   - Created more general pattern matching for concurrency safety warnings

2. Added debug logging to track detected concurrency warnings:
   - Logs now show which concurrency-related terms were found
   - Added context extraction for debugging concurrency issues

3. Enhanced search capabilities:
   - Added grep-based search specifically for concurrency warnings
   - Search results are now included in the debug_info output

4. Improved test suite:
   - Removed references to removed functionality
   - Tests now pass with the enhanced patterns

TESTING:
The modified plugin successfully captures the following types of warnings:
- Static property concurrency warnings (e.g., 'activityIdentifier')
- Main actor isolation warnings
- Actor-isolated instance method warnings
- Other Swift 6 language mode concurrency warnings

Run the following to test:
python3 -c "import xcode_diagnostics; import json; print(json.dumps(json.loads(xcode_diagnostics.get_project_diagnostics('Evokara-gqiejhyaqhlpmpbdgcgnfsdqqwcb')), indent=2))"
